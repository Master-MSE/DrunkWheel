# DRUNK WHEEL

## Description
**DRUNK WHEEL** is an engaging serious game designed to raise awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving. 

This serious game was developed as part of the MA_GT course of the MSE master's degree. The goal was to create a serious game on the theme of health. It had to integrate AI or network functionalities. The rest was up to the students.
